## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This is my first W3F Grant Application 

### Overview

Turn your ideas into investments with MintoCrypto. Ideas are essential to the tech industry. But ideas are just as fragile as they are valuable. We want to disrupt the market with MintoCrypto aims to make it easy for anyone to mint their idea, a trademark, a phrase, or even a new feature for an existing product on the block chain.

- Using the technology behind NFTs to mint your intellectual property permanently on the blockchain
  - mint an app, business, or tech idea 
  - a trademark or phrase 
  - maybe even feature for an existing product or app
  - schematics

The idea is with decentralized ledgers it would be impossible to produce who was first to mint their genius.

- The tokens can be launched on 
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

### Project Details

Our team has had success developing and designing to our professional standard. We are now seeing funding through grants to incentivise and fund the foundation and tech stacks needed to build our industry disrupting vision. The grant funds will go towards exploring  

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
- We are not an NFT art company evenn though we have a world class 3D artist on the team
- We do not see value in bored apes but the technology behind those apes is the next evolutionary  phase of the internet.

### Ecosystem Fit

### Team's experience

Roomi - I'm a full stack developer with 10 years of experience specializing in e-commerce, fintech, real estate, and education. I have a deep understanding of the latest technologies and am passionate about building beautiful web applications. I have an eye for stunning, and functional design experiences that enhance user engagement. I am proficient in prototyping UX/UI and producing MVPs on the latest design application.

My ability to think abstractly makes me well equipped to resolve ambiguous/unexpected problems. Currently I am mastering React for its potential into Web3 and Shopifyâ€™s CLI. I have recently made some Shopify themes, learnt liquid in the process, and have become a certified Shopify Development Partner. Despite my accomplishments thus far, MintoCrypo is what keeps me up late at night and gets me out of bed every morning

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

<!-- This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
-->
